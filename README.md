# Investigating Gender Imbalances In Billboard Charts Over the Years

## Abstract

This analysis seeks to uncover gender imbalances in the Billboard Top 100 and Hot 100 charts over the years. The three main areas of focus were the gender distribution on the Billboard charts, the differences between audio features and lyrics in songs sung by male artists vs. female artists, and whether or not female artists who continue to stay relevant need to reinvent themselves more than male artists. My findings suggest that males might be overrepresented in the charts, but there are not any immediate differences between the lyrics written by male vs. female artists and female artists do not seem to be changing their music more than male artists. More data would need to be collected in order to further the analysis and gather more concrete conclusions.

## Data Sources

### Billboard Top 100 from 1950-2015

A dataset containing Billboard Top 100 songs from 1950-2015 can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinschaich/billboard). The data is in JSON format, and can be obtained by cloning the repo. The data appears to be part of an open source project and has an MIT license. This dataset contains the artists and lyrics for all the songs in the Billboard top 100 over several years so it would allow me to analyze the content of the lyrics and the artists associated with those songs.

```
{
    "title": [string],              # Title of the song.       
    "artist": [string],             # Artist of the song.
    "year": [int],                  # Release year of the song.

    },
    "f_k_grade": [float],           # Flesch–Kincaid grade level of lyrics.
    "flesch_index": [float],        # Flesch reading ease score.
    "fog_index": [float],           # Gunning-Fog readability index.
    "difficult_words": [int],       # Number of words not on the Dale–Chall "easy" word list.
    "num_syllables": [int],         # Number of syllables in lyrics.
    "num_words": [int],             # Number of words in lyrics.

### Billboard Hot 100 Spotify Audio Features

Another dataset that contains Billboard Hot 100 song features from 8/2/1958-12/28/2019 can be found [here](https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017). The Spotify audio features of the songs will allow me to analyze how the underlying music has changed. This dataset is available for public use. More information about Spotify audio features can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/), but I've included a description of the data below.

| danceability              | float   | describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| energy                    | float   | a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.                                                                                                                        |
| key                       | integer | estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard   Pitch Class notation  . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| loudness                  | float   | overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db                                                                                                                                                                                |
| mode                      | boolean | indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by true and minor is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| speechiness               | float   | detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |
| acousticness              | float   | confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| instrumentalness          | float   | predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0                                                                                                      |
| liveness                  | float   | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| valence                   | float   | measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| tempo                     | float   | overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Billboard Top 100 Artists' Genders

My final dataset is one containing artists' genders. This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rkibria/singersgender). This dataset is from Kaggle and is available for public use. The fields for this dataset are described below. One thing to note is that this dataset only labels artists as "male" or "female". There are no labels for groups, and there are no labels for people who identify as nonbinary. 

| Field    | Type   | Description                             |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| artist   | string | name of musical artist                  | 
| gender   | string | gender (male/female)                    | 
| category | string | category based on their Wikipedia pages |
